          Hannah is a whitewater raft guide turned software engineer. When she's
          not <br />
          studying with General Assembly, she's spending time outside, pursuing{" "}
          <br />
          another new hobby or chatting with friends over a large glass of wine.{" "}
          <br />
          For this full stack project, Hannah managed the team GitHub and tried
          her <br />
          best to embody a true renaissance woman, dabbling a little in all
          aspects of <br />
          the project.

          Sara's passion has revolved around the music industry, graphic design
          <br />
          and festivals in the Atlanta area. She has always had a curiosity for
          <br />
          how computers and how machines work, with a borderline compulsive urge
          <br />
          to take video gear apart. During this General Assembly project, she
          has
          <br />
          enjoyed designing and styling the App with her amazing team and
          helping
          <br />
          think out logic behind functionality.

          Long live little Cheeseman!
