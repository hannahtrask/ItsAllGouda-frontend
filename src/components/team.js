        Sara's passion has revolved around the music industry, graphic design
        and festivals in the Atlanta area, and worldwide. She has always had a
        curiosity for how computers and how machines work, with a borderline
        compulsive urge to take video gear apart. Her time spent in the
        immersive program at General Assembly was one of the best challenges of
        2020. Learning a new skill that will allow her to grow more within the
        entertainment industry as well as being able to enter a new "world" is
        exactly the optimism and bright future the dull year needed.
